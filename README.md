# Predicting Cirrhosis Patient Survival Using Machine Learning Algorithms
Survival analysis plays a crucial role in medical decision-making, particularly in predicting life expectancy for patients. 
Abstractâ€” Cirrhosis, a consequence of
prolonged liver damage, presents significant
challenges in clinical care, often necessitating liver
transplant as a life-saving option. Survival analysis
plays a crucial role in medical decision-making,
particularly in predicting life expectancy for
patients. This paper explores the application of
Machine Learning models, including k-nearest
neighbours (KNN), and support vector machines
(SVM), in predicting liver transplant survival rates.
Utilizing data sourced from a seminal Mayo Clinic
study conducted from 1974 to 1984 on primary
biliary cirrhosis (PBC), our study investigates the
efficiency of machine learning algorithms in
predicting survival outcomes for cirrhotic patients.

I. INTRODUCTION
Chronic liver diseases, pose significant health
challenges globally, contributing to substantial
mortality rates. Understanding the factors
influencing the survival rates of cirrhosis patients is
important for effective medical management and
resource allocation. In this study, we investigate the
predictive modelling of survival rates among
cirrhosis patients, leveraging machine learning
techniques applied to a comprehensive dataset
consisting of demographic, clinical, and laboratory
features. The dataset used in our study originates
from the Mayo Clinic experiment sourced from
Kaggle.
The target variable in our analysis represents the
status of patients, categorized into three classes: C
(censored), CL (censored due to liver
transplantation), and D (deceased).
We explore the application of two prominent
machine learning algorithms: Support Vector
Machines (SVM) and k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).
SVM is renowned for its ability to construct optimal
decision boundaries in high-dimensional feature
spaces, while KNN offers simplicity and
adaptability to diverse datasets. Our objectives are
as follows:
1. Develop and implement advanced machine
learning algorithms tailored for multi-class
classification to accurately predict cirrhosis
survival rate.
2. To assess the predictive performance of different algorithms

   The dataset used in our study originates from the
Mayo Clinic experiment conducted between 1974
and 1984, focusing on primary biliary cirrhosis
(PBC) of the liver. The shape of the dataset is (7905,
20) and contains demographic information, clinical
features, and laboratory measurements. We obtained
the dataset from Kaggle.
algorithms, providing insights into their
strengths and limitations.
